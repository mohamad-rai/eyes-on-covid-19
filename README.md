## eyes on Covid-19
In this web app, I tried to show the statistics of Covid-19 in different countries to the users in the form of a chart.
## how to run
just run in a server and index.php knows how to proceed
Note that we have used an api on our site to translate the names of countries into Persian, and I have placed its file and database in the countries folder.
To modify the translation address, change the CURL address in line 18 of the index file.
## framework
[Jquery](https://jquery.com)
